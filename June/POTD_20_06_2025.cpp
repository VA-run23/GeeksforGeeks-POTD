/*
    1. Check if the array size is divisible by k â€” if not, forming equal groups is impossible.
    2. Use a multiset to store all elements in sorted order and allow duplicates.
    3. Continuously take the smallest element as the start of a group.
    4. Try to find k consecutive integers starting from that smallest element.
    5. If any required consecutive element is missing, return false immediately.
    6. If found, erase those k elements from the multiset and continue.
    7. Repeat until all elements are grouped successfully; return true if complete.

    Time Complexity: O(n log n), due to multiset insertions and lookups for each of the n elements.
    Space Complexity: O(n), for storing n elements in the multiset.
