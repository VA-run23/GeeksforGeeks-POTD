/*
    This function detects and counts the number of nodes in a loop using Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm.
    Two pointers, slow and fast, traverse the list at different speeds to detect a cycle.
    If they meet, a loop is present, and we pass the meeting point to a helper function.
    The helper function counts the nodes in the loop by traversing from the meeting node until it loops back.
    Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the list.
    Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra space is used besides a few pointers.
    This approach works reliably regardless of node values and handles all edge cases efficiently.
