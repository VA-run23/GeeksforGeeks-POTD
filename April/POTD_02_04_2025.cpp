/*  
    1. The class `Solution` contains functions for Breadth-First Search (BFS) traversal of a graph.  
    2. The `bfs` function initializes necessary data structures and starts BFS from node `0`.  
    3. A queue `q` ensures nodes are explored level by level while maintaining proper order.  
    4. The `visited` vector prevents nodes from being processed multiple times, avoiding cycles.  
    5. Nodes are dequeued one by one, added to the result vector `ans`, and their neighbors are checked.  
    6. If a neighbor hasnâ€™t been visited, it's marked as visited and enqueued for processing.  
    7. Finally, `bfs` returns the `ans` vector containing the BFS traversal result.
