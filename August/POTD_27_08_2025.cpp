    1. The array is first sorted to ensure that triangle inequality can be checked efficiently.
    2. We iterate through all triplets (i, j, k) such that i < j < k.
    3. For each triplet, we check if arr[i] + arr[j] > arr[k], which is the triangle condition.
    4. If the condition is true, we count the triangle by incrementing 'ans'.
    5. If the condition fails, we break early since further values of k will only be larger.
    6. This approach avoids checking all combinations and leverages sorting for early termination.
    7. Time Complexity: O(nÂ³) in worst case; Space Complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used.
