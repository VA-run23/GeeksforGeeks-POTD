/*
    1. The array is first sorted to allow efficient selection of elements with controlled spacing.
    2. Binary search is applied on the possible minimum difference range from 0 to max(arr) - min(arr).
    3. For each mid value, we greedily try to select k elements such that each is at least mid apart.
    4. We start with the first element and count how many elements satisfy the spacing condition.
    5. If we can select k elements, we try for a larger minimum difference; otherwise, we reduce it.
    6. The final answer is the largest minimum difference for which k elements can be selected.
    7. Time Complexity: O(n log(maxDiff)), Space Complexity: O(1) â€” efficient for large inputs.
