/*
    1. This function checks if the string `tar` can be formed from `pat` using stack-like operations: append or delete.
    2. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` starting from the end of `pat` and `tar` respectively.
    3. If characters at `pat[i]` and `tar[j]` match, both pointers move leftâ€”simulating a successful append.
    4. If they don't match, we simulate a delete by skipping two characters from `pat` (one append + one delete).
    5. The loop continues until either string is fully traversed.
    6. If all characters in `tar` are matched (`j < 0`), return true; otherwise, return false.
    7. Time Complexity: O(n) where n = length of `pat`; Space Complexity: O(1) as no extra space is used.
