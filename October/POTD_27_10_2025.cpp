/*
    1. This function finds the k pairs with the smallest sums from two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2.
    2. It uses a min-heap (priority_queue with greater<>) to always extract the next smallest sum efficiently.
    3. Initially, it pushes pairs formed by arr1[i] and arr2[0] for the first k elements of arr1 into the heap.
    4. Each heap entry is a tuple: (sum, i, j), where i and j are indices in arr1 and arr2 respectively.
    5. In each iteration, the smallest sum pair is popped and added to the result; then the next pair (i, j+1) is pushed if valid.
    6. This ensures we explore pairs in increasing order of sum without generating all combinations.
    7. Time Complexity: O(k log k), Space Complexity: O(k) â€” since at most k elements are in the heap and result.
